## My Thoughts

+ Life gives meaning to existence.

+ Luck, good or bad, emerges out of a need for survival; not for an individual alone but for the group as a whole.

+ Until something is pointed out by someone conscious of it, the thing in question does not exist; "conscious" is a metaphor for something previously undiscovered.
